## Motivation:

- Economic convergence is important for regional cohesion and competitiveness

- Inconclusive literature about Latin America: Convergence vs Divergence vs Convergence Clubs (Galvao and Reis-Gomes, 2007; Barrios et. al, 2018; Martin and Vazquez, 2015)

- Development potential of Latin America constrained  by low productivity (Daude and Fernndez-Arias, 2010; Pages 2010; Restuccia, 2013)

  
## Research Objective:
  
- (Re)evaluate the convergence hypothesis across economies in Latin America with particular emphasis on productivity differences and the formation of multiple convergence clubs. 

  
## Methods:

- Nonlinear dynamic factor model  (Phillips and Sul, 2007, 2009)
- Clustering algorithm for panel data (Phillips and Sul, 2007, 2009)

## Data:

- Labor productivity and total factor productivity (Fernandez-Arias, 2017)
- 20 Latin American countries over the 1980-2014 period

## Main Results:

1. **Lack of overall(global) convergence** in both labor productivity and total factor productivity

2. **Multiple local convergence clubs:** above and below the average

3. **Convergence clubs characteristics:** 

  - Labor productivity: **Four clubs** of countries
  - Total factor productivity: **Three clubs** of countries
  - Clubs show non-parallel trends: crossings, limited stability, and separating trends
  - The lowest-productivity club (Honduras and Nicaragua) is diverging from the rest **at the highest speed**.

# (1) Some stylized facts
**Productivity heterogeneity across Latin America**

Labor productivity

Total factor productivity

class: middle,center

## Large and heterogeneous productivity differences across Latin America

![](figs/fig00a.png)

Note: Labor productivity is computed as the long-run trend of (log) GDP per worker. The Hodrick-Prescott filter with a smoothing parameter of 6.25 is applied to obtain the long-run trends.

## Large and heterogeneous productivity differences across Latin America

![](figs/fig00b.png)

Note: Total factor productivity is computed by dividing GDP per worker by an aggregate index of physical capital and human capital. The Hodrick-Prescott filter with a smoothing parameter of 6.25 is applied to obtain the long-run trends.

# Convergence framework (brief overview)

- First, define a relative transition parameter, $h_{it}$, as

$$h_{it}=\frac{y_{it}}{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}y_{it}}$$

- Second, the convergence hypothesis is defined as

$$H_{t}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(h_{it}-1\right)^{2}\rightarrow 0$$

In other words, when the relative transition parameter converges to unity, $h_{it}\rightarrow1$, the cross-sectional variance converges to zero, $H_{t}\rightarrow0$.


- Thrid, Phillips and Sul (2007) test this hypothesis by using the following log t regression model

$$log\left(\frac{H_{1}}{H_{t}} \right)-2log\left\{ log\left(t\right)\right\}  =  a+b\:log\left(t\right)+\epsilon_{t}$$

# Concluding Remarks



- Reject the (overall) convergence hypothesis both in terms of labor productivity and total factor productivity

- Multiple convergence clubs below and above the mean

- The clubs show different convergence speeds and separating tendencies.
  -The poor economic performance of Honduras and Nicaragua is driving the separation of clubs over time.

## Implications and further research

- Convergence clubs may help us identify economies facing similar challenges
- Call for better coordination and cooperation policies both within and between clubs
  -  International technology transfer initiatives to improve economic cohesion and competitiveness in Latin America.
  
- Masked behind the low productivity of Latin America, there is still a high degree of heterogeneity that is worth exploring
  - Next extension: (Re)evaluate the composition of convergence clubs using subnational data, which is to be constructed using satellite nightlight data.
